## Introduction
If we treat agriculture as a system, we can think about inputs and outputs. Even within the scope of crop production, there can be several outputs, but in this case, we will focus on yield. 
![System](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86243647/144937676-59044697-3ea8-47fe-9649-e4b22c0bb1f4.PNG)
The input side can be summarized in 3 major categories: seed genetics, machinery interaction, and environmental factors. Depending on these inputs and how they interact, it can result in different yields. To optimize the system, we can manage macro-level practices that can affect the overall performance of a crop. For example, by implementing the right irrigation system for a specific crop in a set environment, we can positively shift the yield and, as a result, optimize the system. However, even then, there are still plant-to-plant variations that affect the overall performance of the crop.

By studying and understanding these variations, we could precisely tweak each plant's inputs and increase the yield by moving those low-yielding plants to a higher yield.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/lizbethp/516x-FinalProject/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lizbethp/516x-FinalProject/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
